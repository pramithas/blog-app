			<p>Books are like wormholes, taking you instantly into a
				different universe and a time frame. For me, reading a book is like
				journey at the end of which I will meet a new me.</p>

			<p>Writing is a process of revelation to me. The way of getting
				to know myself. Getting to know the person that is hiding inside me.

				Sometimes it is a pursuit of pure freedom and bliss. Sometimes it is
				the purging of darkness inside me. Either way, I am one step closer
				to myself.</p>

			<p>Programming is my passion. A silent place, a beautiful song
				playing on my ear phones and my fingers dancing over my keyboard.
				This is my ideal day. For me programming is a kind of poetry, an
				art. A beautiful program is like a beautiful painting pleasing to
				both mind and soul. So I sometimes like to call myself an artist.</p>
